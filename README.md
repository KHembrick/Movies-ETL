The purpose of this project is to help Britta prepare for the hackathon. A hackathon is an event where teams of analyst collaborate to work on a project, usinfg data to solve a problem. Britta and I had to gather data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, combine them, and save them into a SQL database so that the hackathon participants have a nice, clean dataset to use. To do this we will need to extract, transform and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.
